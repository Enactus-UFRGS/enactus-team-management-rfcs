# Summary

Here we will discuss the architecture for the first version of the Enactus Team Management System.
This involves which features will be developed, which classes/models
will be added and how they relate to each other.

# Motivation

We want the Enactus Team Management System to be open source and an opportunity of learning
to any Enactus developer. The first opportunity we see is to provide our first developers
the chance to elaborate a good and well thought architecture for the first version of the software
seeking a great code quality application.
